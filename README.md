## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass

### What I learned

During the project I tried using Sass for the first time. I found it helpful when working with more complex designs. I also applied skills of Flexbox and Grid, which helped me polish some of the uncertainties that I encountered during my previous projects.
It was also my first time using LocalStorage in a personal project and I would like to work with it more in the future.

### Continued development

I want to use Sass more, but instead of using an extension to compile it, I would prefer using a different tool, as in my case it stopped watching the changes at some moment.
I would also like to focus on modular approach more, as it surely helps with organizing code, thus speeds up development.
